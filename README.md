To create a SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system for a Formula Student AI, you'll need to simulate data from sensors such as an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and measurements of cone positions (which could come from cameras, LiDAR, or other sensors). This simulated data will allow you to develop and test your SLAM algorithm. Here's a step-by-step guide to simulate the required data and plot a 2D map:
1. Set Up the Environment

You can use a programming language like Python, along with libraries such as NumPy for data manipulation, Matplotlib for plotting, and possibly ROS (Robot Operating System) for more advanced robotics simulations.
2. Simulate the Vehicle's Path

Create a simulated path for your vehicle. This path can be a predefined route or a random walk. Here's an example of generating a simple path:

python

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Parameters
path_length = 100  # Number of steps in the path
step_size = 0.1  # Distance between steps

# Simulate a path (e.g., a simple sine wave)
t = np.linspace(0, 4 * np.pi, path_length)
x_path = t
y_path = np.sin(t)

# Plot the path
plt.plot(x_path, y_path, label="Vehicle Path")
plt.xlabel("X")
plt.ylabel("Y")
plt.legend()
plt.title("Simulated Vehicle Path")
plt.show()

3. Simulate IMU Data

IMU data typically includes acceleration, angular velocity, and sometimes orientation. You can simulate this based on the vehicle's path:

python

# Calculate velocities and accelerations
vel_x = np.diff(x_path) / step_size
vel_y = np.diff(y_path) / step_size
acc_x = np.diff(vel_x) / step_size
acc_y = np.diff(vel_y) / step_size

# Add some noise to simulate real IMU data
noise_level = 0.01
acc_x += np.random.normal(0, noise_level, len(acc_x))
acc_y += np.random.normal(0, noise_level, len(acc_y))

# Plot the simulated accelerations
plt.plot(acc_x, label="Acc X")
plt.plot(acc_y, label="Acc Y")
plt.xlabel("Time step")
plt.ylabel("Acceleration")
plt.legend()
plt.title("Simulated IMU Data")
plt.show()

4. Simulate Cone Positions and Measurements

Assume the cones are placed at fixed positions on the track. Simulate the sensor measurements (e.g., distance and angle to each cone):

python

# Cone positions (example positions)
cones = np.array([[2, 1], [3, -1], [4, 2], [5, -2], [6, 0]])

# Function to simulate distance measurements to cones
def simulate_cone_measurements(x, y, cones):
    measurements = []
    for cx, cy in cones:
        distance = np.sqrt((cx - x)**2 + (cy - y)**2)
        angle = np.arctan2(cy - y, cx - x)
        measurements.append((distance, angle))
    return measurements

# Simulate measurements for each path step
all_measurements = []
for x, y in zip(x_path, y_path):
    measurements = simulate_cone_measurements(x, y, cones)
    all_measurements.append(measurements)

# Plot cone positions and path
plt.scatter(cones[:, 0], cones[:, 1], color='red', label="Cones")
plt.plot(x_path, y_path, label="Vehicle Path")
plt.xlabel("X")
plt.ylabel("Y")
plt.legend()
plt.title("Simulated Cone Positions and Vehicle Path")
plt.show()

5. Develop and Test the SLAM Algorithm

With the simulated data, you can now develop your SLAM algorithm. A basic approach is to use an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or Particle Filter to estimate the vehicle's position and build the map. Hereâ€™s a high-level pseudocode outline for an EKF-based SLAM:

    Initialize the state (position, orientation) and covariance matrix.
    Predict the state using the IMU data (motion model).
    Update the state with the cone measurements (measurement model).
    Iterate through the dataset, updating the state and map.

6. Plot the 2D Map

Once your SLAM algorithm is running, you can plot the estimated trajectory and the map of cone positions:

python

# Assuming `estimated_path` and `estimated_cone_positions` are outputs from your SLAM algorithm
plt.plot(estimated_path[:, 0], estimated_path[:, 1], label="Estimated Path")
plt.scatter(estimated_cone_positions[:, 0], estimated_cone_positions[:, 1], color='green', label="Estimated Cones")
plt.xlabel("X")
plt.ylabel("Y")
plt.legend()
plt.title("SLAM Output: Estimated Path and Cones")
plt.show()

This outline provides a structured approach to simulate sensor data and develop a SLAM system for your Formula Student AI project. You can expand and refine each part based on your specific requirements and available resources.
